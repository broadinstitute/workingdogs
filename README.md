# workingdogs
This repository contains data files used to illustrate genetic selection with EBVs in the paper "Advancing Genetic Selection and Behavioral Genomics of Working Dogs through Collaborative Science" (currently in preparation)

The R script make_plots.R makes the plots show in the paper
Four input files are needed to make the plots:
GEB.EBV_by_dog.plot_data.csv
GEB.LabradorRetriever.inbreeding_coef.plot_data.csv
GEB.phenotype_counts_by_year.plot_data.csv
GEB.pup_success.plot_data.csv

In addition, we have included files containing:
the pedigree (pedigreeBLUPF90.csv)
inbreeding coefficients (inbreedingBLUPF90.csv)

We have also included the EBV data:
bodysens2020.csv (body sensitivity / body awareness)
harness2020.csv (harness sensitivity)
hips2018.csv (hips - ofa)
pt5Tbcls2020.csv (behavior checklist scores)
skin2020.csv (skin traits)
thunder2018.csv (thunder phobia)
